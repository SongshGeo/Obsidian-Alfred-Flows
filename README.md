# An Alfred-WorkFlow for obsidian managing

## Introduction

I prefer to use Alfred to customise my own workflow than to install a bunch of plug-ins bundled with the software. This allows for light coupling between my tools and software, which creates more possibilities and reduces dependency on one tool or another. This workflow is made by [Alfred-workflow in python](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow). 

**What is an Obsidian-Knowledge-Repository? **

[Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.](https://obsidian.md/) If you are building a Obsidian-Knowledge-Repository (OKR) base based on local documents only, then it is a free software. It helps you to create links between electronic notes (if they are all stored in Markdown format) and shows them to you visually through beautiful visualisations. With this visual network you can easily keep track of the development of your body of knowledge.

If you have not had access to Obsidian before, I recommend that you use [my system](https://github.com/SongshGeo/My-Knowledge-Rep) for building your OKRs to better use this WorkFlow tool, here is an demo example:

**What is an Alfred WorkFlow?**

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is on the top of productivity tools in MacOS. By using Alfred, you can access any amazing repeatable and trivial task with one hotkey easily. With Alfred's [WorkFlow](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/), you can extend Alfred and get things done in your own way. Replace repetitive tasks with workflows, and boost your productivity.
